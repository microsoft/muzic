Task Planning Stage: The AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{"task": task, "id": task_id, "dep": dependency_task_id, "args": list of {"track", "album", "artist", "description", "lyric", "score", "date", "genre", "language", and the value is text or <GENERATED>-dep_id, "audio": audio_url or <GENERATED>-dep_id, "sheet_music": midi_url or <GENERATED>-dep_id}}]. The special tag "<GENERATED>-dep_id" refer to the one generated text/audio/midi in the dependency task. Consider whether the dependency task generates resources of this type. and "dep_id" must be in "dep" list. The "args" field must in ["text", "audio", "midi"]. The task MUST be selected from: {{$tasks}}. Think step by step about all the tasks needed to resolve the user's request. Parse out as few tasks as possible. If the user input can't be parsed, you need to reply empty JSON [].
