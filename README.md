**Muzic** is a research project on AI music that empowers music understanding and generation with deep learning and artificial intelligence. 
Muzic is pronounced as [ˈmjuːzeik] and '谬贼客' (in Chinese). Besides the logo in image version (see above), Muzic also has a logo in video version (you can click here to watch <a href="https://ai-muzic.github.io/muzic_logo/"><img src="img/muzic_video_logo.PNG" title="Muzic Video Logo" height="15"/></a>). Muzic was started by [some researchers](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/ai-music/) from [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/) and also contributed by outside collaborators.

For more speech related research, you can find from this page: https://github.com/microsoft/NeuralSpeech and https://speechresearch.github.io/.

### We are hiring! 
We are hiring both research FTEs and research interns on **AI music, speech, audio, language, and machine learning**. Please contact Xu Tan (xuta@microsoft.com) if you have interests. 


### What is New!
+ We release two new research work on music structure modeling: [MeloForm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14345) and [Museformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10349).
+ We give a tutorial on [AI Music Composition](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2021/10/Tutorial-on-AI-Music-Composition-@ACM-MM-2021.pdf) at [ACM Multimedia 2021](https://2021.acmmm.org/).




## Requirements

The operating system is Linux. We test on Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS, CUDA 10, with Python 3.6.12. The requirements for running Muzic are listed in `requirements.txt`. To install the requirements, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
We release the code of several research work: [MusicBERT](musicbert), [PDAugment](pdaugment), [DeepRapper](deeprapper), [SongMASS](songmass), [TeleMelody](telemelody), [ReLyMe](relyme), [Re-creation of Creations (ROC)](roc), [MeloForm](meloform), and [Museformer](museformer). You can find the README in the corresponding folder for detailed instructions on how to use.
